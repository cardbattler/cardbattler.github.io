## The Big Picture

We recently asked for some help
with narrowing down our name choice for the game.
We asked friends, family, and the DayKnight community
to take a short survey and with 20 responses
these were the results<!--end_excerpt--> with literally no context of the game.

        alt="Column graphs rating the names Celestian Accord, Confluence of Light, Constelleum, and Fractured Constellation 1 through 4."
        longdesc="{{site.baseurl}}/assets/long_descriptions/uninformed_name_survey.md"
    >

We then gave people the following context and asked them to rank the names again.

Our game is a 3 versus 3 turn-based arena competition where players play cards from their hand to control their characters on a hex based map.

Lore wise the game takes place in a fantastical universe where people live on the backs of giant celestial creatures known as the world beasts. Every so often there is a great concordance bringing the people of these worlds together. In celebration of the peace between the worlds they compete in battles of wit, strength, and magic.

With this data and some internal debate we narrowed our options down to Celestian Accord and Constelleum and are trying to decide if we need to lock ourselves in to one sooner than later. In some ways it would be beneficial to have a name to market and build a community around, but it's also taking up mental energy that should be dedicated to development. Regardless of what we do, thank you to anyone who filled out the survey!

Before I pass you on to the other folks I'd like to introduce you to the team you'll be hearing from week to week.

Alex - Graphics/UI/Tools

Matt - Game Core

Mitch - Organization, Design

None of these roles are very hard and fast. The group is extremely democratic and everyone has had their fingers over a variety of elements of the project.
