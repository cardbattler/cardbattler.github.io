### Still Here - Mitch

It has been a loooong time since we posted our original dev blog articles as an experiment about a year ago. At the time we were still fledgling and figuring out where we wanted to take Constelleum. And the good news is that our lack of posts was because we had our heads down working hard to bring our game to life. Now that we are getting close to an alpha state it feels like a good time to start sharing what we've been up to.

The image and character silhouettes are part of our new promotional art that we will be revealing when the time is right. In the meantime you can check out our first 3 fully designed characters and learn more about them on their character pages. I hope you love them as much as we do!

And that's it for this dev blog! I know, I know, I'm such a tease. There will be a lot more information in the near future, we just couldn't wait to share any longer. Catch you in the next one.
