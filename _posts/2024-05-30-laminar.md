Laminar

(He/Him)

![Full body portrait of Laminar](/assets/images/2024-05-30-laminar/laminar.png)

*Laminar feels unseen currents allowing him to flow like water itself; enhancing both his body and mind.*

Laminar has 3 states, flowless, flow, and ebb. Flow and ebb allow him to take different advantages from his cards. Once in flow gaining flow will switch back and forth between flow and ebb. Failing to gain flow on a turn returns him to the flowless state.
