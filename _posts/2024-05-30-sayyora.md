(She/Her)

![Full body portrait of Sayyora](/assets/images/2024-05-30-sayyora/sayyora.png)

*Sayyora's magical prosthetics enable her love of solitary rambling across the countryside. Her style is a juxtaposition of seclusion and community.*

Sayyora gains Rambling value automaticlly for each tile she moves. This resources is consumed to pick up orbs and score, but is also used to scale Range, Movement, and Disrupt values on her cards. Sayyora is unable to both pick up and score orbs in the same round. Her exceptional movement capabilities make her excell at positioning on the field.
