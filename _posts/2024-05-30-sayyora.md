(She/Her)

![Full body portrait of Sayyora](/assets/images/2024-05-30-sayyora/sayyora.png)

*Sayyora's prosthetics enable her rambling across the countryside, preferring long distance traveling*

For every tile Sayyora moves, her Rambling increases, which in turn increases her Range, Movement, and Disrupt. Rambling is consumed when Sayyora picks up orbs or scores, and she is unable to both pick up and score orbs in the same round.
