(She/Her)

*After seeing the belly of Kinaara Selene gained the ability to shift her form to that of a wolf. Controlling and knowing when to use this ability has been a learning process.*

Selene automaticlly cycles between her human and wolf forms every 2 rounds and has cards that interfere with the cycle. As a human she is a defensive character, as a wolf she becomes more aggressively slanted and can't be defeated at the cost of being unable to pick up and score orbs.
