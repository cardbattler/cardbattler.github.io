*Since being exposed to the light of the belly of the World Turtle Kinaara, Selene has been able to shift to a wolf form. When in a human form, Selene uses moonlight and gravity to move players around the field.*

Selene cycles between her human and wolf forms every 2 rounds, and her cards flip. In human form, her cards focus on forcing movement and statuses. As a wolf, Selene's cards focus on damage. Selene can not be defeated or pick up orbs as a wolf.
