Since the last devlog,
we have been heads down
building, polishing, and testing.
We are very happy to announce 3 new playable characters,
Gimbal, Gnamma, and Selene!
Check them out on the [character gallery page]({{site.base_url}}/characters/)!
For the rest of this article, I will dig further into each character
than the summary cards present.

People who follow the game or have had a chance to play test it
will recognize<!--end_excerpt--> some of the new faces in the gallery.
Gimbal, Gnamma, and Selene have appeared in play tests for some time
as we refined their design and mechanics.
Come join us on

if you would like to be a play-tester!

## [Gimbal]({% post_url 2024-05-30-gimbal %})

Gimbal has more than an electric personality,
they also control electricity itself!
A scientist and engineer, Gimbal plays with an array of gadgets
powered by their un-patented **Jolt Jars**.
Think of Jolt Jars like magic batteries
they allow Gimbal to build up or release **Charge**.

Players familiar with how Valencia's **Adrenaline** builds up
may notice similarities with Gimbal's charge.
Gimbal can spend Charge to activate or increase the effects
of their cards on their turn.
Planning ahead becomes important,
as Charge can be hard to come by.

Dissimilar to Valencia, however,
Gimbal creates persistent (and dangerous!) **Obstacles**
that change the playing field.
The Obstacles allow Gimbal to architect the flow of play,
enabling allies or hampering opponents.
Gimbal is a great choice for players that want to set a trap
or play 2 steps ahead of the opposing team.

## [Gnamma]({% post_url 2024-05-30-gnamma %})

<figure>

If Kaleesi is the mother of dragons,
then Gnamma is the mother of warthogs.
Top Hat and Mullbery
(development names that just stuck, and we love that they did)
are Gnamma's **Companions** that can be **Summoned** to help on the field.

Gnamma is similar to Gimbal in her "set-and-forget" nature.
Top Hat and Mulberry play their own cards at the beginning of each round.
During their turns, they are controlled by our Companion engine,
a rule-based artificial intelligence (AI) system.
The rules are designed to be easily interpretable,
so Players can play around the furry little beasts.

Gnamma is the primary choice for players that want to role-play
as a Pokemon trainer.
But do not think that Gnamma is passive!
Gnamma's deck is stacked with cards
that let her act through her Companions via **Extend**,
giving her one of the widest range of influence
available in the game.

## [Selene]({% post_url 2024-05-30-selene %})

<figure>
    <img 
        src="/assets/images/2024-05-30-selene/selene.png" 
        alt="Full body portrait of Selene"

</figure>

Selene can become a hulking, biting, clawing wolf
at the drop of a pin.
When she takes a break from more lupine endeavors,
she enjoys throwing players around the field with anti-gravity.
Supportive and disruptive,
Selene can change the face of the field
with a single meteoric strike.

Selene was one of the first characters
conceptualized for Constelleum.
We always wanted support-style characters
to have tools for direct impact.
Selene's cards are kitted to force other players,
both teammates and opponents,
to new locations on the field.
She also includes some options to **Fortify** (heal) her teammates
as well as adding and removing statuses.

Selene's change in play style is triggered by **Shift**,
and it is not subtle.
From a floating, flowing form to a biting, brawling beast.
As a wolf, all of Selene's cards flip to be completely different cards.
Wolf cards are focused on taking and dealing damage.
As a wolf, Selene cannot pick up or score **Orbs**, but she also becomes
**Stubborn** and cannot be defeated.

## And More

People who follow the game or have had a chance to test it
will recognize some familiar faces
that have been beautifully restored.
The changes in art accompany in-game animation and shader improvements,
leading to more satisfying and responsive gameplay.

Stay tuned as we regularly release
new cards, new animations, and new particle effects.
