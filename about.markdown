Constelleum is a card-driven tactics game.

When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! Besides, you look good in a dress. I can't. As much as I care about you, my first duty is to the ship. Then maybe you should consider this: if anything happens to them, Starfleet is going to want a full investigation. I am your worst nightmare! Commander William Riker of the Starship Enterprise. We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. I'll alert the crew. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? Maybe we better talk out here; the observation lounge has turned into a swamp. About four years. I got tired of hearing how young I looked. The Enterprise computer system is controlled by three primary main processor cores, cross-linked with a redundant melacortz ramistat, fourteen kiloquad interface modules. Computer, lights up! I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. This should be interesting. Your head is not an artifact! We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. A lot of things can change in twelve years, Admiral. Sorry, Data. Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately?
