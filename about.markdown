Constelleum is a multiplayer arena game with a rich character pool that switches out the high physical demands of the FPS and MOBA genres for a card driven tactics core that rewards decision making and teamwork over physical precision.

The idea for Constelleum formed in the fall of 2019 when one of our team members started having carpal tunnel issues. The entire team have enjoyed competitive video games with distinctive character pools such as Overwatch, Smash Bros, and Dota, but recognized a gap in the market for games that scratch these itches while being physically inclusive.

With little to no prior game development experience we set out to make our idea a reality. The last year and a half has involved a ton of learning and redoing what we thought we knew. We can't wait for you to see the results of our hard work!
