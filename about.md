## The Game

Constelleum is a multiplayer cardbattler arena game
where two teams of two or three compete
to score orbs in goals and defeat their opponents.

- Before games, players can construct personalized decks for a cast of characters.
- Before rounds, players select a card to play from their hands.
- On their turns, players take the actions on their chosen card
  while interacting with their teammates and opponents.

The idea for Constelleum sparked in the fall of 2019
when one of our team members developed limitations owing to carpal tunnel.
The entire team enjoyed asymmetric, competitive video games
including titles like Overwatch, Smash Bros, and Dota,
but identified a need for inclusive gaming experiences
that cater to diverse player preferences and physical abilities.
The physical demands of FPS and MOBA games were replaced
with a turn-based, card-playing tactics core
that rewards decision making and teamwork
over reaction time or mechanical precision.
Constelleum is built to bridge the gap,
providing a joyfully cooperative,
fiercely competitive,
and deeply inclusive experience.
