Constelleum is a team tactics cardbattler with accessibility at its heart.

## The Rules

Two teams of two or three compete
to score orbs in goals
and defeat their opponents.
The team that scored the most orbs at the end of 12 rounds wins.

- Before games, players construct personalized decks for a cast of characters.
- Every round, players select a card to play from their hands.
- On their turns, players take the actions on their chosen card
  while interacting with their teammates and opponents.

## The Idea

We made Constelleum accessible from design through development.

The answer to "Can I play that" should always be "yes."

Compounding issues from a genetic disorder
blocked Mitch from playing a genre we love to play together:
asymmetric cooperative arena battlers.
Our favorites are Overwatch, Smash Bros, and Dota 2.

But there aren't enough inclusive games
that cater to diverse physical abilities.
So we swapped the physical demands of FPS and MOBA games
for a turn-based, card-playing tactics core.
Cooperative decision making is rewarded
over reaction time or mechanical precision.

**We need more multiplayer games that we all can play together.**
