## Key highlights

- **Flexible input**: Play Constelleum using your favorite input.
- **One-Handed play**: Experience the full game with just one hand.
- **Complete customization**: Tailor every aspect of the game
  to what you need.

## Features

### Supported controls

- **Game pad**: Game pads that connect to Steam let players use the
  directional pads and buttons to move and select.
- **Mouse only**: Every interface interaction or game action
  includes a clickable button, card, or board tile.
- **Keyboard only**: The UI and the play field are fully navigable
  with arrow keys and selectable via the space bar.

All controls are fully re-mappable in-game, for all control schemes.

### Visuals

- **Colorblind options and customizable colors**:
  - User Interface (UI) panel and font colors
    are customizable via a color picker.
  - Pre-configured colorblind profiles are available,
    and we will continue to expand the catalogue at the request of players.
- **Background modulation**:
  - Backgrounds can be blurred, darkened, and desaturated to enhance visual
  clarity.
  - Background animations can be disabled.
- **Outline modulation**:
  The outlines that surround characters, teammates, and enemies
  can be adjusted to preference or for need.
- **Customizable text size**: UI, Card, and Field Text sizes are all customizable,
    and care has been taken to maintain readability at different sizes
- **Auto-selection and auto-confirmation**:
  By default, we want to make sure users know what they are agreeing to before
  they submit a card.
  Players who want to click fewer actions can toggle
  automatica selections in the settings,
  which confirms actions for which there is only one choice.
- **Resizable window**: The game window can be expanded to a preferred size
  or toggled to full-screen.
- **Visual indicators**: All audio cues are accompanied by visual indicators.

### Gameplay

- **Turn-based mechanics**: A slower-paced game that reduces the need for
  quick reactions while maintaining tense strategy and competitive tactics
- **Adjustable timers**: Game timers can be modified in lobbies.
  An option is available to remove timers entirely
  for learners and casual players.
- **Comprehensive tooltips**:
  Every game element includes informational tooltips on hover.

## Please, ask for what you need

Our current accessibility features are based on our accessibility vision
and standard industry practices,
but we believe we can improve.

- **Help us be better**: If you need a specific feature to play the game,
  *please* let us know.
  That is why we are making Constelleum.
- **Commitment to accessibility**:
  We aim to make the game as accessible as possible.
- **Player centered**: We trust you to know what you need,
  but we strive to deliver without having been asked.
