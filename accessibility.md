At Constelleum, accessibility is at the heart of our mission.
Learn more about our commitment in [About Us]({{site.base_url}}/about#the-idea).

## Key highlights

- **Flexible**: Play Constelleum using your favorite input.
- **Minimal**: Experience the full game with just one hand.
- **Customizable**: Tailor every aspect of the game
  to what you need.

## Features

### Supported controls

- **Game pad**: Game pads that connect to Steam let players use the
  directional pads and buttons to move and select.
- **Mouse only**: Every interface interaction or game action
  includes a clickable button, card, or board tile.
- **Keyboard only**: The UI and the play field are fully navigable
  with arrow keys and the enter key.
- **Touch**: Tablets running Windows can use the touch with on-screen buttons.
- **Multiple Devices**: Multiple input devices can be used simultaneously.
  So play on mouse and keyboard, or a dance pad and a touch screen!

### Control options

- **Fully re-mappable** - All controls can be changed in-game for all supported control schemes.
- **Minimal input** - The game is fully controllable with six inputs:
  Accept, cancel, and four directions for navigation.
  A joystick can replace the separate inputs for navigation.
- **Auto-selection and auto-confirmation**:
  By default, we want to ensure users know what they are agreeing to 
  before they submit a card.
  However, players who want fewer clicks can toggle
  automatic selections in the settings,
  which automatically selects and confirms actions
  for which only one choice is available.
  For example, a Disrupt action with only one target within range.

### Visuals

- **Colorblind options and customizable colors**:
  - User Interface (UI) panel and font colors
    are customizable via a color picker.
  - Pre-configured colorblind profiles are available.
    We will continue to expand the catalogue, prioritizing player requests.
- **Background modulation**: Background animations can be disabled.
- **Outline modulation**:
  The outlines that surround characters, teammates, and enemies
  can be adjusted to preference or for need.
- **Customizable text size**: UI, Card, and Field Text sizes are all customizable.
    Great care has been taken to maintain readability
    across display ratios.
- **Resizable window**: The game window can be expanded to a preferred size
  or toggled to full-screen.
- **Visual indicators**: All audio cues are accompanied by visual indicators.

### Gameplay

- **Turn-based mechanics**: A finely-tuned game pace reduces the need for
  quick reactions while requiring thoughtful strategy and competitive tactics.
- **Adjustable timers**:
  Game timers can be adjusted in lobby settings.
  New players can slow down to learn
  and experienced players can increase the intensity
  for a race against the clock.
- **Comprehensive tooltips**:
  Every game element includes an informational tooltip
  that describe related game mechanics.
  The opponents are the challenge, not the rules.

## Please, ask for what you need

Our current accessibility features are based on our accessibility vision
and standard industry practices,
but we believe we can improve.

- **Help us be better**: If you need a specific feature to play the game,
  *please* let us know at <accessibility@constelleum.com>.
  This is why we made Constelleum.
- **Commitment to accessibility**:
  We aim to continue to make the game as accessible as possible.
- **Player centered**: We trust you to know what you need,
  but we strive to deliver without having been asked.
