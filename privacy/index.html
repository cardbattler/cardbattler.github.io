  <li>To protect the Service, our employees, and our business’s rights or safety
Other than that, we will not share your personal data with anyone else.</li>
</ul>

<p>4.	How long do we keep your personal data?
We only keep your personal data as long as it’s required to provide you with the Service. Sometimes a longer period might be required by law. 
After that, we will delete your personal data within a reasonable time.</p>

<p>Please note that we may retain some data, if necessary to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>resolve disputes,</li>
  <li>enforce our user agreements,</li>
  <li>follow any technical and legal requirements related to the Service.</li>
</ul>

<p>5.	Children’s privacy rights
We don’t knowingly collect any personal data from children under the age of 13. We also don’t knowingly allow them to create accounts, sign up for newsletters, make purchases, or use the Service. 
We may also limit our personal data processing for EU users between 13 and 16.
We take children’s privacy seriously and encourages parents to play an active role in their children’s online experience. If you have any concerns about your child’s personal data, please contact us at privacy@constelleum.com.</p>

<p>6.	Transfers of your personal data
Our headquarters is in the United States. 
No matter where you live, by using the Service you consent to the processing and transfer of your personal data in and to the United States. This processing will be under the privacy policies of third parties that we share personal data with. 
The laws of the United States governing data collection and use may not be as comprehensive or protective as the laws of the country where you live. 
If you would like more information, please contact us (see “How to contact us” below).</p>

<p>7.	EU residents’ rights
We are regulated under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which applies across the European Union (including in the United Kingdom). We are responsible as a controller of personal data for GDPR purposes.</p>

<p>Your rights as an EU resident:
Under the GDPR, EU residents have several important rights:</p>

<ul>
  <li>By law, you can ask us what information we hold about you, and you can ask us to correct it if it is inaccurate. If we have asked for your consent to process your personal data, you may withdraw that consent at any time.</li>
  <li>If we are processing your personal data for reasons of consent or to fulfill a contract, you can ask us to give you a copy of the information in a machine-readable format so that you can transfer it to another provider.</li>
  <li>If we are processing your personal data for reasons of consent or legitimate interest, you can request that your data be erased.</li>
  <li>You have the right to ask us to stop using your information for a period of time.</li>
  <li>Finally, in some circumstances, you can ask us not to reach decisions affecting you using automated processing or profiling.
If you would like to exercise any of those rights, please email us at privacy@constelleum.com. We may ask for additional info to verify that you’re the owner of that data. 
Also, in some cases where the law requires it, we may not be able to help with the above requests.</li>
</ul>

<p>8.	California residents’ rights
We are regulated under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which applies to California residents. 
Under the CCPA, California residents have several important rights:</p>

<p>Right to Know: You can ask us what personal data we hold about you and request a copy. This includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The type and specific pieces of personal data we have collected</li>
  <li>The types of sources we collect the data from</li>
  <li>The purpose for collecting your personal data</li>
  <li>The third parties we share that data with
Right to Delete: You can request that we erase your personal data. There are some exceptions to this right, if we:</li>
  <li>Need to complete the transaction for which the personal data was collected or if there is an ongoing business relationship or contract with you</li>
  <li>Detect security incidents and protect against malicious, deceptive, fraudulent, or illegal activity</li>
  <li>Need to identify and repair errors affecting Service functionality</li>
  <li>Exercise free speech or ensure another consumer can exercise (or another lawful right)</li>
  <li>Need to comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act</li>
  <li>Engage in research in the public interest</li>
  <li>Enable solely internal uses that are in line with your expectations for using your personal data</li>
  <li>Need to comply with a legal obligation</li>
  <li>Otherwise use your personal data internally, in a way that’s compatible with the reason we collected it in the first place
Sale of your personal data: We don’t sell any of your personal data for any purposes.
Other Rights: California residents also have the right to request information about our disclosure of personal data to third parties for direct marketing purposes during the calendar year before your request. This request is free and may be made only once a year. 
We also won’t discriminate against you for exercising any of the rights listed above.
If you would like to exercise any of those rights, please email us at privacy@constelleum.com. We may ask for additional info to verify that you’re the owner of that data.</li>
</ul>

<p>9.	Brazilian residents’ rights
We are regulated under the Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados (“LGPD”), which applies to Brazilian residents. 
Under the LGPD, Brazilian residents have several important rights:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Know when we use your personal data</li>
  <li>Access your personal data, correct any errors, or delete your personal data</li>
  <li>Anonymize, block, or delete data that we don’t need or are not processing in compliance with the LGPD</li>
  <li>Request we transfer your data to another provider</li>
  <li>Be informed about who we share your data with</li>
  <li>Be informed about your ability to deny consent and any consequences</li>
  <li>To revoke your consent
These rights apply to any personal data collected or processed in Brazil, as well as any personal data processed for the purpose of providing goods or services in Brazil.
If you would like to exercise any of those rights, please email us at privacy@constelleum.com. We may ask for additional info to verify that you’re the owner of that data.</li>
</ul>

<p>10. How do we protect personal data?
We have taken steps and put security measures in place to prevent the accidental loss or misuse of personal data. 
For example, we limit access to those who have a genuine business need. Those processing your information will do so only in an authorized manner.
We also have procedures in place to deal with any suspected data security breach. We’ll notify you and any applicable regulator of a suspected data security breach when legally required.</p>

<p>11. Resolving Disputes
We hope that we can resolve any questions or concerns you raise about our use of your personal data. 
Please contact us at privacy@constelleum.com to let us know if you have questions or concerns. We will do our best to resolve the issue.
For EU residents, the GDPR also gives you right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority. You may do this in the EEA state where you live, work, or where any alleged infringement occurred.</p>

<p>12. How will we notify you of changes?
We last updated this Privacy Policy on 9/15/2022.
We may make further updates from time to time. If we have your email address on file, we will inform you via email. Otherwise, we will post a message on the Service about the change.</p>
