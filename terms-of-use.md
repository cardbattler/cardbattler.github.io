14\. Disclaimer of Warranties

Your use of the Service is entirely at your own risk. 

The Service is provided by Constelleum Games on an as-is basis. Constelleum Games expressly disclaims all warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including, but not limited to the implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.

Constelleum Games makes no warranty that (i) the Service will meet your requirements, (ii) that operation of the Service will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free, or (iii) the results that may be obtained from the use of the Service will be accurate or reliable. 

No advice or information, whether oral or written, obtained by you from Constelleum Games, or through the Service creates any warranty regarding the Service not expressly stated in this Agreement.
To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, no Third-Party Platform is a party to this Agreement or your purchase or license of the Service. None of the Third-Party Platforms make any warranties, or assume any warranty or other obligations with respect to: (i) the Service, or (ii) any claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs, or expenses attributable to the Service, including any warranties arising from claims of infringement of intellectual property or personal rights, products liability, or failure of the Service to perform, execute, or conform to any standard.

Because some states or jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties, the foregoing disclaimer will be limited to the fullest extent permitted by law.

15\. Limitation of Liability

You expressly understand and agree that neither Constelleum Games nor any Third-Party Platform is liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages, including damages for loss of profits, goods, goodwill, use, data, or other intangible losses (even if Constelleum Games or the Third-Party Platform has been advised of the possibility of such damages), resulting from the use or the inability to use the Service or any other matter relating to the Service.

You hereby expressly and irrevocably waive, and agree never to assert any claims against any Third-Party Platform that you may have under any theory of law or equity anywhere in the world, in connection with rights licensed under this Agreement, your possession or use of the Service, or the content of the Service. Any claims arising out of the Service are subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement and may be brought only against Constelleum Games, as described in Sections 21 and 22 below.

Because some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or the limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, in such states or jurisdictions, the liability of Constelleum Games and its affiliates will be limited to the fullest extent permitted by law.

16\. Indemnification

You agree to indemnify and hold Constelleum Games and its affiliates, officers, agents, and employees harmless from any claim, demand, loss, costs, or expense, including attorneys’ fees, made by any person or entity arising out of your violation of this Agreement, state or federal laws or regulations, or any other person’s rights, including infringement of any copyright or violation of any proprietary or privacy right. Under no circumstances, including any negligent act, will Constelleum Games or its affiliates or agents be liable for any damages of any kind that result from the use of, or the inability to use, the Service.

17\. Your Personal Information

Certain personal and other information that we collect, process, and share is subject to our Privacy Policy.  As a condition of using the Service you agree to the terms of the Privacy Policy, as it may be changed from time to time. Our Privacy Policy, which is incorporated here by reference, is located at https://constelleum.com/privacy. You agree that your use of the Service is subject to the Privacy Policy.

18\. Disclosures Required by Law

Constelleum Games reserves the right to disclose any information, including personally identifiable information about you, as necessary to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request. Constelleum Games reserves the right to fully cooperate with any law enforcement authorities or court order requesting or directing Constelleum Games to disclose the identity of any user believed to be in violation of this Agreement.
By accepting this Agreement, you waive all rights and agree to hold Constelleum Games harmless from any claims resulting from any action taken by Constelleum Games during or as a result of its investigations or from any actions taken as a consequence of investigations by either Constelleum Games or law enforcement authorities.

19\. Legal Compliance

By using the Service, you represent and warrant that (i) you are not located in a country that is subject to a U.S. Government embargo, or that has been designated by the U.S. Government as a “terrorist supporting” country; and (ii) you are not listed on any U.S. Government list of prohibited or restricted parties.

20\. Third-Party Beneficiary

You acknowledge and agree that the Third-Party Platforms are third party beneficiaries of this Agreement, and that, upon your acceptance of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, any of the foregoing third parties will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce this Agreement as a third-party beneficiary.

21\. Governing Law; Mediation; Jurisdiction

The Agreement, and all future agreements you enter into with Constelleum Games, unless otherwise indicated on such other agreement, will be governed by the laws of the State of Minnesota. This is the case regardless of whether you reside or transact business with Constelleum Games, or any of its affiliates or agents, in the State of Minnesota or elsewhere. Unless a dispute would be governed by the terms of Section 22 below, you agree to submit to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located within the city of Morris, Minnesota, USA.

For EU users only: In the event of a dispute relating to the interpretation, performance, or validity of this Agreement, an amicable solution can be sought before any legal action. You can file your complaint with Constelleum Games by sending a message via email to support@constelleum.com. In case of failure, you can, within one year of the failed request, have recourse to an Alternative Dispute Resolution procedure by filing an online complaint on the European Commission’s Online Dispute Resolution website: https://webgate.ec.europa.eu/odr/main/index.cfm?event=main.home.chooseLanguage. In the event that out-of-court dispute resolutions fail, the dispute may be brought before the competent courts.

22\. Binding Arbitration

Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of the Service (each, a “Claim”) will be resolved by binding arbitration, rather than in court (except that you may assert claims in small-claims court if your claims qualify). You agree that each Claim must be brought individually.

YOU AND CONSTELLEUM GAMES AGREE THAT (i) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE ARBITRATED ON A CLASS ACTION BASIS OR TO UTILIZE CLASS ACTION PROCEDURES; (ii) THERE IS NO RIGHT OR AUTHORITY FOR ANY DISPUTE TO BE BROUGHT IN A PURPORTED REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY OR AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL; AND (iii) NO ARBITRATION MAY BE JOINED WITH ANY OTHER ARBITRATION.

The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this Agreement and this binding arbitration clause.

Arbitration is a process with no judge or jury – an arbitrator will review the arguments in the dispute and award damages and other relief just like a court would. The arbitrator must follow this Agreement as a court otherwise would. Court review of the arbitration award is limited under the Federal Arbitration Act.

To start an arbitration, you must send an email to support@constelleum.com describing your Claim and requesting arbitration, or we may do the same by sending a written notice requesting arbitration to your address. The proceedings will be conducted through JAMS, using their Streamlined Arbitration Rules and Procedures. You can view these rules at jamsadr.com or by calling 800-352-5267. The payment of the initial filing fees will be made by the party filing the Claim, and any other filing and other fees will be apportioned as directed by the JAMS rules. The arbitration will take place in Morris, Minnesota, USA, unless the Parties agree to video, phone, or internet connection appearances.

Except as otherwise set forth below, you may seek any remedies available to you under federal, state or local laws in an arbitration action. As part of the arbitration, both you and Constelleum Games will have the opportunity for discovery of non-privileged information that is relevant to the Claim. The arbitrator will provide a written statement of the arbitrator’s decision regarding the Claim, the award given (including any attorneys’ fees and costs awarded), and the arbitrator’s findings and conclusions on which the arbitrator’s decision is based.

Notwithstanding the terms of this Section, either of us may bring a lawsuit in court for equitable relief, for any misuse or infringement of intellectual property rights, or for any Claim related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use of the Service.

BY AGREEING TO THIS ARBITRATION PROVISION, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT YOU AND CONSTELLEUM GAMES WAIVE THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL.

You and Constelleum Games agree that if any portion this Section is found illegal or unenforceable, that portion will be severed and the remainder of the Section will be given full force and effect.

23\. Miscellaneous Terms

23.1.	Agreement Revisions. This Agreement may only be revised in writing by Constelleum Games, or by Constelleum Games’ publication of a new version on the Service.

23.2.	Force Majeure. Constelleum Games is not liable for any delay or failure to perform resulting from causes outside the reasonable control of Constelleum Games, including without limitation any failure to perform hereunder due to unforeseen circumstances or cause beyond Constelleum Games’ control such as acts of God, war, terrorism, riots, embargoes, acts of civil or military authorities, fire, floods, accidents, strikes, or shortages of transportation facilities, fuel, energy, labor, or materials.

23.3.	No Partnership. You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and Constelleum Games as a result of this Agreement or your use of the Service.

23.4.	Assignment. Constelleum Games may assign this Agreement, in whole or in part, to any person or entity at any time with or without your consent. You may not assign the Agreement without Constelleum Games’ prior written consent, and any unauthorized assignment by you will be null and void.

23.5.	Severability. If any part of this Agreement is determined to be void, invalid or unenforceable, then that portion will be severed, and the remainder of the Agreement will be given full force and effect.

23.6.	Attorneys’ Fees. In the event any litigation is brought by either party in connection with this Agreement, the prevailing party in such litigation will be entitled to recover from the other party all the reasonable costs, attorneys’ fees and other expenses incurred by such prevailing party in the litigation.

23.7.	No Waiver. Our failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement will in no way be construed to be a present or future waiver of such provision, nor in any way affect the right of any party to enforce every such provision thereafter. The express waiver by us of any provision, condition or requirement of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of any future obligation to comply with such provision, condition or requirement.

23.8.	Equitable Remedies. You hereby agree that Constelleum Games would be irreparably damaged if the terms of this Agreement were not specifically enforced, and therefore you agree that we will be entitled, without bond, other security, or proof of damages, to appropriate equitable remedies with respect to breaches of this Agreement, in addition to such other remedies as we may otherwise have available to us under applicable laws.

23.9.	Entire Agreement. This Agreement, including the documents expressly incorporated by reference, constitutes the entire agreement between you and Constelleum Games with respect to the Service and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications, whether electronic, oral or written, between you and Constelleum Games with respect to the Service.
